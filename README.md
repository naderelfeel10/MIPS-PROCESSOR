# MIPS-PROCESSOR
This is a MIPS Processor Design Project using VHDL, aimed at simulating a basic CPU by implementing key components such as register file, ALU, control unit, and memory integration. The project is divided into two phases:

Phase I: Basic MIPS CPU with R-type Instructions
 Implement a 32-register file with simultaneous read and write operations.
 Develop a 32-bit ALU supporting AND, OR, ADD, SUB, NOR.
 Integrate the register file and ALU into a simple MIPS CPU.
 Ensure the CPU can execute R-type instructions: AND, OR, ADD, SUB, SLT, and NOR.

Phase II: Expanding the MIPS CPU
 Implement a Control Unit to manage instruction execution.
 Extend support for I-type instructions (lw, sw, beq) and J-type instructions.
 Connect the Datapath with Control Unit and Memory Modules.
 Load and execute a sample program from memory.
 Simulate and verify results.

Technologies Used:
VHDL (Hardware description language)

Quartus / ModelSim (For simulation and testing)

Digital Logic Design (Register file, ALU, Control Unit, Datapath)
